JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains a series of JavaScript tasks focused on objects, scopes, and closures.

Task Descriptions

Task 0: Rectangle #0

Create an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

Task 1: Rectangle #1

Create a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. 
The class should have a constructor that takes two arguments, w and h, and initializes the instance attributes width and height accordingly.

Task 2: Rectangle #2
This task builds upon Task 1.
Create a class Rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments, w and h. 
The class should initialize the instance attributes width and height. Additionally, if w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, an empty object should be created.

Task 3: Rectangle #3
Create a class Rectangle with a constructor that takes two arguments, w and h. 
The class should initialize the instance attributes width and height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, an empty object should be created.
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character "X."

Task 4: Rectangle #4
This task extends the Rectangle class from Task 3. 
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and height of the rectangle and another instance method called double() that multiplies the width and height of the rectangle by 2.

Task 5: Square #0
Create a class Square that defines a square and inherits from the Rectangle class from Task 4. 
The constructor of the Rectangle class must be called using super(), and the Square class should only take one argument, size.

Task 6: Square #1
Task 6 extends the Square class from Task 5. 
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the square using the character c. 
If c is undefined, it should default to using the character "X."
